3 Years Experience is a show about navigating your early career. 

While navigating their early careers, two friends, Cara and Julia, realized they had many questions but no answers to the common conundrums that pop up when we're first starting a "real job": how do I look and sound professional when I really have no idea what I'm doing?  I hooked up with my coworker, now what? Should I go back to school? How do I give tough advice to my manager?

Sure, we've had our high school and college jobs and navigated ourselves (questionably) well enough to this point where we have a 9 to 5, but we are still saplings, just putting down our roots into our years of career growth

This is a topic that I know has eager listeners and learners. It has an audience with my coworkers who just got laid off, my peers deciding whether they can afford to live in San Francisco, my friends trying to define their passion. A lot comes up when we're in our late 20s, upper 30s and navigating the way. 

In these 30 minute podcasts, my goal is to bring the people with experiences to the people who have questions.
